# 👨‍💼 Employee Data Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project demonstrates basic data analysis and visualization on a small-scale **employee dataset** using Python. It highlights how we can uncover trends and insights about salaries, work hours, experience, department distribution, and promotion status.

## 📌 Features

- Overview and structure of the dataset
- Identification of unique values and column distributions
- Missing values check
- Data visualizations:
  - 📊 Histogram of Salaries
  - 📊 Bar Graph of Department Distribution
  - 📦 Box Plot of Experience (to find outliers)
- Outlier detection using the IQR (Interquartile Range) method

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) – Data manipulation and analysis
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) – Numerical operations
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) – Plotting and graphing
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) – Statistical data visualization

## 📈 Sample Visualizations

- Histogram showing salary distribution
- Box plot identifying experience outliers
- Department frequency bar chart

## 🔍 Outlier Analysis

This project includes an example of how to:
- Calculate Q1, Q2 (Median), Q3
- Compute IQR
- Define upper/lower bounds
- Detect outlier employees based on experience

## 🚫 Missing Values

The dataset was verified to have no missing values.
